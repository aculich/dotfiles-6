/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-08-27)
 */

This week was mostly spent on Lind; I'm having a few issues getting a VM
to actually run on a netbook, so I've mostly been reading the
documentation in the rrapper repository until I can get a new laptop.

        [CrashSimulator]

        After spending a day or so trying to get a VM running on my
        netbook unsuccessfully, I've shelved it for now and have been
        reading the documentation on writing a mutator which Preston
        has up in his rrapper repository.

        [Lind]

        I was able to modify our glibc execve() implementation to take
        normal argument and environment vectors instead of concatenating
        them into a single space-separated string as the previous
        implementation did.

        Busybox, coreutils, dash, and bash all now compile without
        issue, so my next step is getting a LAMP stack up and running. I
        am still running into a few issues getting busybox to actually
        run, but that's not really super important at this point so I'm
        putting it off for now (coreutils and the shells are all pretty
        much working).

        I'm still having some issues figuring out why the shells (dash
        and bash) are segfaulting when I stub rt_sigprocmask(), but
        hopefully I'll have that ironed out by the end of the week.

/* Plans For Next Week */

        - Figure out why bash and dash segfault when I stub
          rt_sigprocmask().
        - Start building Apache with our Lind compiler.
        - Figure out why busybox segfaults when run in Lind.
        - Start planning out which exact programs will be part
          of our LAMP stack.

That's all for this week, thanks everyone.
