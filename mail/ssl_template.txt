/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-08-06)
 */

This week I've been working on fixing our Travis build for Lind and some
portability problems rr. I've had to spend a lot of time on a few logistics
issues with NYU supplier registration, so I wasn't able to get a huge
amount done this week.

        [CrashSimulator]

        I spent some time doing a little debugging of some weird errors with
        Preston when running our build of rr, and it turns out that rr itself
        is working fine, but there are issues with making the our traces
        portable (mostly an issue in regard to our test suite). At current,
        it looks like it's the same issues Mozilla was also having, so
        I've been reading the source code and brainstorming possible
        solutions.

        I've also been trying to figure out how to port our tools to x86_64,
        since have to test small changes in a 32-bit VM is slightly annoying.

        [Lind]

        I managed to get a reverse shell up and running in our Travis CI
        instance for debugging purposes, but I haven't really figured out
        the cause of our build failures yet.

        If this takes too long, I may just put it to the side for now
        and finish up our execve() implementation so we can start getting
        some testing of real programs done.

/* Plans For Next Week */

        - Figure out why our Travis CI build for Lind is failing.
        - Finish up our LInd execve() implementation.
        - Start building our LAMP stack for Lind.
        - Start testing some coreutils programs in Lind.
        - Work on 64-bit support for CrashSimulator.
        - See if there are any tractable solutions for our portability issues.

That's all for this week, thanks everyone.
