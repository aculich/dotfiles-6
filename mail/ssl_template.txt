/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-11-06)
 */

This week I worked on finalizing a working Travis CI configuration for
Lind. The strategy which eventually ended up working was to split up the
large toolchain build into three parts: downloading and checking out the
source repositories, building the custom glibc/gcc toolchain, and
building nacl/repy then installing them to the final target directory.

Splitting it up this way worked around the original problem of the
Travis CI build timing out at 50 minutes, the current hard maximum, and
although I'm still working on figuring out a way to get the download and
glibc parts of the build automated, the nacl/repy build is the most
frequently worked on part of Lind and the part which benefits the most
from having a CI system set up.

I created a PR for this Travis CI configuration and have so far received
some review on it from Lukas. After it's fixed up and I've addressed
any comments I receive in code review, I'll be merging it into the main
branch.

I also worked on a 32-bit Docker build of CrashSimulator which, although
it does currently build successfully, I have doubts about it working
100% correctly. Preston is going to test it out and let me know later
whether or not he is able to use it for his classes, and we can decide
based on that if is a useful avenue to pursue further.

* Plans For Next Week */

        - Help Preston out with addressing issues that students post
          to his pkmoore/rrapper repository over the coming weeks.
        - Figure out why running dash/bash background jobs segfault
          in Lind.
        - Figure out an approach to automate the download and glibc
          parts of our Lind builds.
        - Revise my Travis CI nacl PR as comments come in and eventually
          merge it.

That's all for this week, thanks.
