/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-09-05)
 */

This week I don't have too much to report. I spent most of it cleaning
up and finalizing my NaCl PR [1] and pinging a few people for review.
There were a few spots that needed tiny touch-ups which were caught by
review; I've addressed/fixed them and am currently waiting for more
feedback to come in.

I've also been brainstorming the best way to handle portable environments
(a Dockerfile or VM seem like the best canidates so far) with regard to
CrashSimulator, but haven't conclusively figured out yet what would be the
best route to go.

/* Plans For Next Week */

        - Address suggestions and comments on my NaCl fork() PR as they
          come in.
        - Continue to do research on what the best way to tackle a
          portable environment for CrashSimulator would be.

That's all for this week, thanks.
