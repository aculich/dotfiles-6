/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-09-17)
 */

This week I had to fix up a couple of errors with the x86-64 CrashSimulator
dependencies, and reading over the syscallreplay and rr code while I
wait for the laptop I've ordered to come in. It should be coming within the
next week, and then I can get back to being able to actually test things
again.

I've also been reading over the Lind Repy code and poking at it so that
little by little I can figure out how changing it behaves. There were
a few places with questionable style, but I don't want to really make
and non-essential changes to the code yet until I am certain I understand
how the system works.

In addition, I've been cleaning up my execve() implementation to prep for
a future PR. The only real thing I have to figure out here is the correct
way to get the Repy implementation of pipe to interface nicely with my C
code (and actually act like a pipe() transparently).

* Plans For Next Week */

        - Continue to work on the Repy implementation of pipe().
        - Setup my development environment once my new laptop comes
          in
        - Test out the x86-64 parts of CrashSimulator I've already
          finished and make sure they still function correctly.
        - Figure out a workaround for the glibc `ucontext_t`
          changes which end up breaking the ABI for anything
          using that structure (such as rr).

That's all for this week, thanks.
