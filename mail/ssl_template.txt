/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-10-24)
 */

This week was mostly working on the CrashSimulator close() mutator, with a
little bit of time spent merging in the execve() PR to Lind.

I was actually able to get the mutator written for close() fairly easily,
however I was (and still sort of am, admittedly) having trouble figuring
out how to correctly _run_ the modified trace file so that it uses the
config.ini with the desired changes.

    * The docs for this part are kind of lacking in my opinion, and I think
      this should be fixed up a little more before having other people come
      onto the CrashSimulator project cold; otherwise, they would be in for
      some minor frustration.

I've also been trying out the Docker image method as an alternative to get it
running, and although there were a few snafus building it, I'm currently
coalescing all of the needed Dockerfile changes into a PR for rrapper and they
are all fairly small ones. In addition, I also submitted a couple of small rr
PRs for bugfixes and spelling which Preston has already merged in this week.

I've also been slowly learning the Python C API, as well as refreshing
myself on how the rest of Python works at the same time, so I can get pipe()
implemented smoothly in the coming week.

* Plans For Next Week */

        - Continue to work on the mutator for CrashSimulator.
        - Work with Preston to improve the rrapper documentation.
        - Implementing pipe() in our Repy code for Lind.

That's all for this week, thanks.
