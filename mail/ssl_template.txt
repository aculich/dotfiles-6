/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-10-07)
 */

This week I spent cleaning up my Lind execve() changes and rebasing them
into a PR. With a lot of the needed infrastructure changes taken care of
already in my previous fork() PR, this ended up being fairly smooth,
with only about 600 lines of code added.

This also included a temporary (but working) internal runtime implementation
of pipe(), although the goal is still to have this handled completely within
Repy eventually. I also spent some time going over python docs and thinking
about the best way to use "threading" for our purposes in this implementation.
In addition, I did already get some review on my PR from Justin and Brendan
and addressed the issues they brought up.

I've been neglecting CrashSimulator a bit, so I'm going to be figuring
out the mutators over this coming week, as well as working out our
python-based pipe() implementation for Lind.

* Plans For Next Week */

        - Read the documentation on how to do traces and write mutators for
          CrashSimulator.
        - Try and actually write a mutator for CrashSimulator.
        - Respond to code review suggestions on my Lind execve() PR.
        - Figure out a concrete implementation plan for pipe().

That's all for this week, thanks.
