/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-11-12)
 */

I spent some time cleaning up my Travis CI PR for Lind and attempting to
get httpd compiled using the Lind toolchain. I've been having to fix a
lot of weird compiler errors related to the Apache Portable Runtime that
httpd uses, and I'm still trying to iron those out completely.

I've been looking at how the previous httpd was compiled and trying to
work off off that, so it should be good to go by the end of the week. My
Travis CI PR is almost ready for me to ask Lukas for another round of
review.

I've spent some time trying to fix a couple issues Preston was having in
his rrtest script, such as a PR I made to slim down the original output
and only print out the most relevant lines. There were also a couple
places I needed to add array bounds checking and adjust the number of
context lines printed when too close to the head and tail of the list.

* Plans For Next Week */

        - Continue to help Preston out with addressing issues posted
          to his pkmoore/rrapper and pkmoore/rr repositories.
        - Finalize my Travis CI PR and ask Lukas for another round of
          review.
        - Get httpd successfully compiled and figure out which parts of
          it are broken, if any.
        - Start compiling the rest of the LAMP stack.

That's all for this week, thanks.
