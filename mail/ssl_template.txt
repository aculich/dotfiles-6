/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-10-01)
 */

This week I've spent getting the development environment for CrashSimulator
up and running, as well as taking care of some small Lind-related cleanups
and integration.

I've gotten most of rr working currently; I was able to successfully record
a trace and play it back. I haven't completely gotten the VM parts of it
working yet, but since I'm mostly concentrating on 64-bit support this
shouldn't be too much of a problem.

The PR for Lind has been merged in, and now I'm going to give the Repy
parts of it some thought to see ts there is a simple way to update it to
the latest Repy v2.

I'm not going to spend too much time on that however, and after the Repy
update I will be focusing on getting my execve() PR cleaned up and ready
to go so that we can continue moving forward with Lind.

* Plans For Next Week */

        - Start figuring out how to do traces and write mutators for
          CrashSimulator.
        - Figure out if there is a quick and easy way to update our
          Repy code in Lind.
        - Start prepping the execve() part of NaCl for a PR into the
          Lind branch.
        - Give the entire build system for Lind a quick run through and
          see if there are unneeded parts of it which we can eliminate.

That's all for this week, thanks.
