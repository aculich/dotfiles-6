/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-09-08)
 */

This week I spent re-reading the Lind and CrashSimulator papers and
going over the code to see how the systems correlate with each part of
the papers. I did notice a few little things to be cleaned up, so I made
a quick PR for syscallreplay to avoid pointer aliasing issues.

I've spent the majority of my time learning how the Repy part of Lind
works, as it's the part of the system I understand the least. I made
a development branch and started the skeleton of the pipe() Python
implementation, granted I'm still piecing together exactly how each part
of the system works so it's still pretty rough.

I was, however, able to get Glibc to call into Repy instead of NaCl fairly
easily, and as I start to understand the system better it will become
even smoother sailing.

* Plans For Next Week */

        - Continue to study the Repy subsystem of Lind.
        - Start to flesh out the Python implementation of pipe().
        - Continue to review CrashSimulator code and look for places to
          make improvements.

That's all for this week, thanks.
