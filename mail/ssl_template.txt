/*
 * Joey's Progress Report
 *
 * (2018-10-31)
 */

This week I spent most of my time improving the parts of CrashSimulator
related to ease of use when testing. I made a couple pull requests to
fix up the documentation and Dockerfile parts of Preston's rrapper
repository, and currently have recording and replaying traces working
fairly smoothly on my main development system.

I don't think CrashSimulator has a working CI system in place right now,
Lind definitely does not, and so my focus for the coming week is going to
be to work with Lukas to try and get a CI working for Lind as well as
try to also set one up for CrashSimulator.

It seems like the best approach in regarding Lind would be to leverage
Docker to split the original, monolithic build into manageable and discrete
parts. This would solve the original issue of build timeouts in Travis CI,
and once we have a working CI build, we can set up web-hooks so that, as an
example, a commit pushed to the NaCl subrepository might trigger a build of
the main project repository.

Once this is all setup for Lind, it will be easy to build and verify a
LAMP stack for NaCl in a reliable way.

I'm not sure what problems would be encountered when trying to setup a
Travis CI instance for CrashSimulator, but I can't think of any reasons
why it wouldn't be possible, so that would be the next step once I have
a working template I can borrow from Lind, as it shares many of the same
subrepository-based challenges.

* Plans For Next Week */

        - Work on getting Travis CI integration for Lind running smoothly.
        - Work on adding Travis CI integration to CrashSimulator.

That's all for this week, thanks.
