 * Joey's Progress Report
 */

Sorry for being missing in action lately. I've been in the hospital at
the psych ward for some personal stuff I'd rather not get into. I'm out
now and trying my best to get into the groove for work, going to try to
attend tomorrow's Lind meeting, but sorry if I don't make it.

Thanks for understanding guys.

/* Plans For Next Week */

- Get well enough to get back to work.

That's all for this week, thanks.
