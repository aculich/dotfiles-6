# The **OPSEC** Process

**OPSEC** is a five step, iterative process designed to that assists an
organization in identifying information requiring protection, determining
the methods that may be employed to compromise that information, and
establishing effective countermeasures to protect it.

When formally applied, **OPSEC** is generally conducted in a sequential
manner. However, emergency and dynamic situations may require certain
steps be conducted out of sequence.

### 1. Identify Critical Information

Critical information is a specific fact about friendly (that is,
non-adversarial) intentions, capabilities, and activities that is needed
by adversaries to plan effectively. If Critical Information is obtained,
the adversary would be able to cause friendly mission failure or other
mission degradation.

The first step of the **OPSEC** process is a Critical Information List
(CIL), which is a record of critical information. This list is to be
approved at the command or leadership level of an organization. Usually,
this information represents the core secrets of an organization, and
can vary from one organization to the next.

### 2. Analyze The Threat

Once the critical information is identified, the next step is to determine
the individuals or groups that represent a threat to that information.
There may be more than one adversary, and different pieces of information
may be targeted by different groups. In this stage, the capabilities,
use for the information, determination and resources must also be analyzed.

The primary sources for this information would be intelligence support,
law enforcement or, for contractors under the National Industrial Security
Program, the Defense Security Service.

A properly completed threat assessment documents the adversaries, their
intent, the information they already may already possess, their capability
and intent to collect critical information, and their potential courses
of action.

### 3. Analyze The Vulnerabilities

In this phase, the analyst will "Think like the wolf"- that is, they
will view their organization from an adversary's perspective. The
vulnerabilities of the organization must be thoroughly explored,
especially in terms of physical safeguards, network/electronic
safeguards and personnel training will be investigated.

An indicator is a detectable action and open source information that
can be interpreted or aggregated by an adversary to determine critical
information.

A vulnerability is when a security shortcoming exists that may allow
an adversary to collect critical information or identify indicators
in support of their decision-making processes.

A vulnerability analysis is the friendly examination of processes,
projects, and mission to identify any inherent, natural or self-induced
vulnerabilities.

### 4. Assess The Risks

For each vulnerability, the threat must be matched. At this point,
each vulnerability is assigned a risk level. This is an unmitigated
risk level, meaning that any corrective factors are not included in
the analysis. The risk matrix is as follows:

##### [CRITICAL]
	An adversary has demonstrated their ability to exploit an existing
	vulnerability and the resulting impact would be irreparable; hazard
	consequence would be catastrophic. Critical

##### [HIGH]
	There is no doubt an adversary could exploit an existing vulnerability
	and the resulting impact would be serious enough to consider cancellation
	of a mission; hazard consequence would be major. high

##### [MEDIUM HIGH]
	It is probable an adversary could exploit an existing vulnerability
	and the resulting impact would be damaging; hazard consequence would
	be no higher than major. medium high

##### [MEDIUM]
	It is possible an adversary could exploit an existing vulnerability
	and the resulting impact would be manageable; hazard consequence would
	be no higher than moderate. medium

##### [MEDIUM LOW]
	It is unlikely an adversary could exploit an existing vulnerability
	and the resulting impact would be negligible; hazard consequence would
	be no higher than minor. medium low

##### [LOW]
	It is improbable an adversary would exploit an existing vulnerability
	and the resulting impact would be insignificant; hazard consequence
	would be no higher than insignificant.

The risk level assigned to a vulnerability helps to "triage" the protection
of data.

### 5. Apply The Countermeasures

Beginning with high-risk vulnerabilities, a plan is put in place to
mitigate the risk factors. All possible countermeasures are considered,
and could include additional hardware, training or outside contractors.
The most important element of this step is to develop a plan to lower
or eliminate the risk, or remove the threat's access to the resource.

Countermeasures are selected based on mission priorities and available
resources. Commanders or senior leaders determine which countermeasures
are to be implemented based on the risk and likelihood of exploitation.

Countermeasures also must be continuously monitored to ensure they
remain effective and relevant. Threats change, as do the methods they
may entail or the vulnerabilities effecting an organization. It's important
to review the countermeasures to ensure that they are protecting critical
information against the right threats at the right time.

# The Laws of **OPSEC**

If you don't know the threat, how do you know what to protect? Although
specific threats may vary from site to site or program to program,
employees must be aware of the actual and postulated threats. In any
given situation, there is likely to be more than one adversary, although
each may be interested in different information.

If you don't know what to protect, how do you know you are protecting
it? The "what" is the critical and sensitive, or target, information
that adversaries require to meet their objectives.

If you are not protecting it (the critical and sensitive information),
the adversary _wins! **OPSEC** vulnerability assessments, (referred to as
“**OPSEC** assessments”—OA's—or sometimes as "Surveys") are conducted
to determine whether or not critical information is vulnerable to
exploitation.

An OA is a critical analysis of “what we do” and “how we do it” from
the perspective of an adversary. Internal procedures and information
sources are also reviewed to determine whether there is an inadvertent
release of sensitive information

In short:
> Know the threat, know what to protect, and protect it!
