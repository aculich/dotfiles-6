### Versions

You can get this information from executing `atom --version` and `apm --version` at the command line. Also, please include the OS and what version of the OS you are running. For example, if you were using Arch Linux with the 4.7.5-ARCH kernel, you would report that your OS is Arch Linux and your kernel version is 4.7.5-ARCH. To determine your kernel version run `uname -r`. Please also tell me your pacman version (which can be found by running `pacman --version`).
