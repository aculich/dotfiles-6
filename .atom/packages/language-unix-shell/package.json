As such it conflicts with this package so it is necessary to add this to your `config.cson` if the core `language-shellscript` package is installed:\n\n```coffee\n  disabledPackages: [\n  \"language-shellscript\"\n  ]\n```\n\nin order to use it. It has a number of improvements over the original, namely:\n\n* It has syntax-highlighting for common Unix commands, along with syntax-highlighting for several popular &#42;nix package managers like APT, DNF, pacman, Portage, *etc.*\n* Syntax-highlighting for variable definitions\n\nIf you use this package it is recommended you use the [`dark-bint-syntax`](https://github.com/Murriouz/dark-bint-syntax) theme of Murriouz.\n\nContributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, *etc.*\n",
